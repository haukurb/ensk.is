<h1>About ensk.is</h1>

<p><a href="/"><strong>ensk.is</strong></a> is a <em>free and open public
        domain online English-Icelandic dictionary.</em>
</p>

<p>The author of the original dictionary, Geir T. Zoëga (1857-1928), was an
    English language teacher and later rector at the Learned School of Reykjavík
    in the years 1883-1927. The first edition was published in 1896. The digitised,
    extended and sanitised version presented here is based on the much-improved
    third edition edited by Þorsteinn Þorsteinsson (1932).</p>

<p>The current incarnation of the dictionary has been heavily edited, updated
    and fixed in accordance with modern Icelandic orthography. Many additions have
    been made to bring the vocabulary into the 21st century. Various errors in the
    original text were also corrected.</p>

<p>The dictionary currently contains <a href="/all">{{ num_entries }} definitions</a>,
    of which <a href="/additions">{{ num_additions }}</a>
    are new additions ({{ additions_percentage }}). More statistics <a href="/stats">here</a>.
</p>

<p>Ensk.is provides provides <a href="/docs">an easy-to-use JSON API</a> but you are probably
    better off using the <a href="/files">downloadable version</a> if you need to
    process the dictionary in bulk or with low latency.</p>

<p>The current editor is <a href="mailto:sveinbjorn@sveinbjorn.org">Sveinbjörn Þórðarson</a>.</p>
